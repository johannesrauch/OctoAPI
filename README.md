# OctoAPI
## What's OctoAPI?
OctoAPI is a python library in order to easily access the OctoPrint API. You simply use its functions to retrieve informations about the printer, the current job or print files or issue commands to the printer.

## Installation instructions
- Download both octoapi.py and .octoapi.conf
- Unpack the .octoapi.conf to you're home folder (Linux: ~; Windows: C:\Users\Name) and change its url and api-key
- Save the octoapi.py script whereever you want or use a PYTHONPATH location
- Import the script to your project
- Done!

## Annotation
If you want to use the OctoPrint API at its full extent, the official [OctoPrint documentation](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/api/general.html) is very helpful. Although this script provides nearly every function of the API, for your purposes, you may have to modify mine or write your own.
